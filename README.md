# OCaml: Functional Programming concepts

This repository contains OCaml projects completed to gain proficiency with functional programming concepts. Key areas covered:

## Fish Language Parser

- Building a parser and lexer for Fish - a simple Fortran-like language
- Using OCaml Lex, Yacc or parser combinators

## Fish to MIPS Compiler

- Compiling Fish abstract syntax tree to equivalent MIPS assembly code

## Cish to MIPS Compiler 

- Translating Cish language featuring functions and local variables to MIPS
- Implementing calling convention, environment mapping, etc

## Liveness Analysis and Interference Graph

- Performing liveness dataflow analysis on CFG representation  
- Constructing interference graph from liveness results

## MIPS Interpreter

- Interpreter for subset of MIPS instruction set 
- Practice with state machines and decoding

## MLish Compiler

- Type checking and inference for MLish language  
- Compilation of MLish to Scheme subset

## Scish to Cish Compiler

- Mapping Scish based on Scheme to Cish output
- Getting exposure to compilers and continuations

The projects sharpened skills in lexer/parser construction, dataflow analysis, compilation, type systems and other foundational PL/FP abilities.
